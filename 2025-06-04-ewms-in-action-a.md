title: 'EWMS in Action: A User’s Guide to Adaptive, Extreme-Scale Workflows'

description: The Event Workflow Management System (EWMS) enables previously impractical
  scientific workflows by transforming how HTCondor is used for massively parallel,
  short-runtime tasks. This talk explores what’s now possible from a user’s perspective.
  Integrated into IceCube’s Realtime Alert pipeline and powered by OSG’s national-scale
  compute resources, EWMS’s debut application delivers directional reconstructions
  of high-energy neutrinos within minutes. This talk will showcase how EWMS is accelerating
  discovery today and explore how its capabilities could unlock new research across
  domains—from astrophysics to protein modeling, large-scale text mining, and beyond.
