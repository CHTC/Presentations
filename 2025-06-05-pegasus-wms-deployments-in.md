description: Pegasus is a widely used scientific workflow management system built
  on top of HTCondor DAGMan. This talk will highlight how Pegasus is deployed within
  the NSF ACCESS ecosystem and the NAIRR Pilot. We will cover access point deployments,
  including the hosted ACCESS Pegasus platform (Open OnDemand and Jupyter), workflow
  execution nodes in HPC environments, and a JupyterLab-based access point within
  the Purdue Anvil Composable Subsystem. On the execution side, we will discuss several
  provisioning strategies, including HTCondor Annex, custom virtual machines on the
  Jetstream2 cloud, simple glidein configurations for campus clusters, and a dynamically
  autoscaled TestPool environment designed for workflow development and testing.
