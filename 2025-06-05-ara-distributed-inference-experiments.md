description: We present the initial design and proposed implementation for a series
  of long-baseline, distributed inference experiments leveraging ARA --- a platform
  for advanced wireless research that spans approximately 500 square kilometers near
  Iowa State University, including campus, the City of Ames, local research and producer
  farms, and neighboring rural communities in central Iowa. These experiments aim
  to demonstrate, characterize, and evaluate the use of distributed inference for
  computer vision tasks in rural and remote regions where high-capacity, low-latency
  wireless broadband access and backhaul networks enable edge computing devices and
  sensors in the field to offload compute-intensive workloads to cloud and high-performance
  computing systems embedded throughout the edge-to-cloud continuum. We highlight
  the role of HTCondor as the common scheduler and workload manager used to distribute
  the inference workload across ARA and beyond. We also discuss some of the unique
  challenges in deploying HTCondor on ARA.
