description: Since its establishment in 2006, the MIT Tier-2 computing center has
  been a long-standing contributor to CMS computing efforts. Recently, an opportunity
  arose to take part in the usage of a shared tape storage system operated by Harvard
  University. In the context of a pilot project to explore this system we acquired
  tape cartridges with a total capacity of 15 PB and successfully integrated them
  for use by CMS. A key challenge was the lack of direct access to the tape libraries.
  To address this, we developed a novel setup that is currently unique within the
  CMS infrastructure. In this talk, we present our technical approach and share insights
  that may benefit other sites considering participation in shared tape storage systems.
