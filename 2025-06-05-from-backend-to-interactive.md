description: New requirements from HEP data analysis includes limited access to login
  nodes, resource needed from the experiments program rather than the login nodes
  and efficient data access for collaborative workflows etc. We have developed an
  Interactive aNalysis worKbench (INK), a web-based platform leveraging the HTCondor
  cluster. INK transforms traditional batch-processing resources into a user-friendly,
  web-accessible interface, enabling researchers to leveage the cluster computing
  and storage resources directly via their browsers.
