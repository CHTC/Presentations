description: "Nickolas Pingel science he discusses are the direct result of the “Transformational\
  \ Survey of Local Group galaxies with the Karl Jansky Very Large Array and HTCondor”,\
  \ which was funded by the The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate\
  \ Education’s Research Forward initiative. \nThe success of this project was due\
  \ to the collaboration between Astronomy and CHTC staff (Bockelman, Livny), who\
  \ provided direct training and help via dedicated staff members. Pingel talks about\
  \ the research of radio astronomers which focuses on light emitted in the radio\
  \ regime. Pingel notes that the early results from these surveys are ushering in\
  \ a new observational regime for measuring the thermodynamics of the CNM across\
  \ a diverse range of astrophysical environments."
