description: The Algorithms Research and Development Group (ARDG) at the National
  Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has been using HTCondor and compute resources
  at the Open Science Grid (OSG) to significantly improve throughput in radio astronomy
  imaging by up to 2 orders of magnitude in single imaging workflows, and we are currently
  putting efforts towards extending these imaging capabilities to multiple imaging
  workflows. Besides developing and maintaining software to efficiently process data
  and manage the imaging workflows, we found that monitoring and diagnosing workflow
  executions is critical to achieve and maintain high throughput. We will present
  and discuss some of the tools and methodology that we use to assess workflow health
  and efficiency, which enable us to visualize and solve problems, eventually also
  contributing to optimizing and advancing capabilities of HTCondor and the OSG.
