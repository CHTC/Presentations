description: 'While there are perhaps hundreds of petabytes of datasets available
  to researchers, instead of swimming in seas of data there is often a feel of sitting
  in a data desert: there’s a mismatch between what sits in carefully curated repositories
  around the world versus what’s accessible at the computational resources locally
  available. The Pelican Project (https://pelicanplatform.org/) aims to bridge the
  gap between repositories and compute by providing a software platform to connect
  the two sides. Pelican’s flagship instance, the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF),
  serves billions of objects and more than a hundred petabytes a year to national-scale
  resources. This tutorial, targeted at end-user data consumers and data providers,
  will cover the data access model of Pelican, guide participants to access and share
  data through an existing data federation, and consider how data movement via Pelican
  and the OSDF can enable their research computing.'
