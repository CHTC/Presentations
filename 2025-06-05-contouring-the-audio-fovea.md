description: Bujji Selagamsetty discusses his CHTC GPU workflow. He also noted improvements
  to CHTC Flow, including HTChirp to poll job ad information and self-scheduling job
  length and device specific tuning. In his current work he asks what are the regions
  od 3D audio space where a. speech is more perceptible and b. noise is more distracting.
  Can we map this space at a fine enough granularity to create more personalized,
  spatial audio experiences? Selagamsetty summarizes his CHTC experience working on
  this project.
