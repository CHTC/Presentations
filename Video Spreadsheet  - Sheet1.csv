Recently, an opportunity arose to take part in the usage of a shared tape storage system operated by Harvard University. In the context of a pilot project to explore this system we acquired tape cartridges with a total capacity of 15 PB and successfully integrated them for use by CMS. A key challenge was the lack of direct access to the tape libraries. To address this, we developed a novel setup that is currently unique within the CMS infrastructure. In this talk, we present our technical approach and share insights that may benefit other sites considering participation in shared tape storage systems.",,A Tape Robot for the MIT Tier-2 Center presented by Maxim Goncharov ,HTC25|Collaborations|AdminToolsandServices,,https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2297/contributions/34359/

While the DaemonStartTime and MonitorSelfAge attributes of HTCondor daemons provide a slice of insight as to the uptime and availability of the service, they're not well-suited for tracking longer-term up/down-time stats over the course of days, weeks, or months. Longer-time-period uptime statistics are essential for contractual Service Level Agreement (SLA) management, and are an important aspect of monitoring the overall health of large HTCondor pools.",,Tracking HTCondor Uptime presented by Michael Pelletier,HTC25|AdminToolsandServices,,https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2297/contributions/34372/

Tighter HTCondor and Kubernetes interplay for better glideins ,Igor Sfiligoi and Jamie Frey,HTC25,2025-06-05,path|osg|htcondor|,"HTCondor is the leading system for building a dynamic overlay batch scheduling system on resources managed by any scheduling system, by means of glideins. One fundamental property of these setups is the use of late binding of containerized user workloads. From a resource provider point of view, a compute resource is thus claimed before the user container image is selected. Kubernetes allows for both multi-container requests and dynamic updates to the container image being used. In this talk we show how HTCondor can exploit these features to both increase the effectiveness and the security of gildeins running on top of Kubernetes-managed resources.",,Tighter HTCondor and Kubernetes interplay for better glideins presented by Igor Sfiligoi and Jamie Frey,HTC25|AdminToolsandServices,,https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2297/contributions/33819/

From backend to interactive based on HTCondor,Jingyan Shi,HTC25,2025-06-05,path|osg|htcondor|,"New requirements from HEP data analysis includes limited access to login nodes, resource needed from the experiments program rather than the login nodes and efficient data access for collaborative workflows etc. We have developed an Interactive aNalysis worKbench (INK), a web-based platform leveraging the HTCondor cluster. INK transforms traditional batch-processing resources into a user-friendly, web-accessible interface, enabling researchers to leveage the cluster computing and storage resources directly via their browsers.

Operating a Federated HTCondor Infrastructure: Monitoring and Management for CMS Computing,Bruno Coimbra,HTC25,2025-06-05,path|osg|htcondor|,"The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN generates and processes vast volumes of data requiring significant computing capacity. To meet these demands, CMS has adopted a federated throughput computing model distributed across a global infrastructure based on HTCondor, the CMS Submission Infrastructure. Seamless integration of heterogeneous resources from multiple sites allows for operating a unified, virtualized pool. This infrastructure currently provides access to over 500,000 CPU cores, enabling CMS to efficiently execute a wide variety of data processing and simulation workloads.

This federation, however, comes with substantial operational challenges, notably, the need for robust and scalable monitoring. To ensure reliability, performance, and rapid diagnosis of issues, we have developed a comprehensive monitoring ecosystem that spans job execution, resource availability, and system health across the entire pool. This talk will present the architecture of the CMS federated compute infrastructure, detail the role of HTCondor in enabling global workload distribution, and highlight recent developments in monitoring that are critical to operating such a large-scale system effectively.",,Operating a Federated HTCondor Infrastructure: Monitoring and Management for CMS Computing presented by Bruno Coimbra,HTC25|AdminToolsandServices|,,https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2297/contributions/34411/
