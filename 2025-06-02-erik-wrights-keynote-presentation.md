description: Recent technological advances have revealed an enormous diversity of
  lifeforms by sequencing their genomes. There are now millions of available genomes,
  each comprised of thousands of genes. The universe of newly discovered genes is
  expanding far faster than our ability to study them in the laboratory. Here, Erik
  Wright presents how high-throughput computing is unlocking the function of novel
  genes at an unfathomable scale.
