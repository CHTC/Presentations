description: NSF NCAR’s labs and programs collectively cover a breadth of research
  topics in Earth system science, from the effects of the Sun on Earth's atmosphere
  to the role of the ocean in weather and climate prediction, as well as supporting
  and training the next-generation of Earth system scientists. However, with the current
  legacy `download and analyze’ model followed by most of our remote users, we are
  not realizing the full research potential of NCAR’s wealth of datasets. Our goal
  is to integrate NCAR’s curated data collections with the OSDF data and compute fabric
  to broaden access capabilities. In this talk, we present progress on this collaboration
  and demonstrate geoscience workflows which ingest data from NCAR’s Research Data
  Archive using pelicanFS via OSDF caches.
