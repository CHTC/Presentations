description: The MIT Tier-2 computing center, established in 2006, has been a long-standing
  contributor to CMS computing. As hardware ages and computing demands evolve, we
  are undertaking a major redesign of the center’s infrastructure. In this talk, we
  present a holistic cost analysis that includes not only hardware purchases but also
  power consumption, cooling, and rack space—factors often excluded from conventional
  cost models. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maintaining aging hardware versus
  timely replacement, and propose optimal hardware retirement and procurement policies.
