description: Curt Dodds describes the process of deploying the National Data Platform
  Endpoint (formerly Point of Presence / POP) on local infrastructure to provide a
  data streaming service for a published science dataset where the data origin is
  located in Hawaii. From the perspective of a software engineer, he covers the process
  of deploying the endpoint into a Kubernetes cluster or using Docker Compose. Dodds
  explains how he integrated access to local data with the endpoint and describe some
  useful lessons that were learned. Finally, from the perspective of a science user,
  he demonstrates how to use the deployed endpoint to preprocess data and stream the
  results to a Jupyter notebook to visualize the data.
