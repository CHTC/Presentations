description: Michael Pelletier discusses the usefulness of uptime metrics, how built-in
  daemon attributes are linked to service uptime, how to create custom attribute such
  as an UptimeExecMonthly attribute. While the DaemonStartTime and MonitorSelfAge
  attributes of HTCondor daemons provide a slice of insight as to the uptime and availability
  of the service, they're not well-suited for tracking longer-term up/down-time stats
  over the course of days, weeks, or months. Longer-time-period uptime statistics
  are essential for contractual Service Level Agreement (SLA) management, and are
  an important aspect of monitoring the overall health of large HTCondor pools.
