description: Sameer D'Costa, a scientist with the Computational Biology Group at the
  Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, is investigating  Zymomonas mobilis (bacteria)
  that is really good at turning sugar into alcohol and could be engineered for industrial
  use. D'Costa share his deep learning computational plan and workflow to compute
  complees in Z. Mobilis.
